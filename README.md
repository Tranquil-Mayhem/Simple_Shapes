# Simple Shapes
Some basic shapes made using the Python turtle library. 
Run shapes_main.py to watch the turtle draw some basic shapes on your screen! 
IllusionHelper.py consists of the methods that define each of the basic shapes drawn. 

If you want the turtle to draw all shapes immediately, consider setting the turtle
speed to zero and implementing turtle.tracer at the start of your code.

ex.

turtle.speed(0) 

turtle.tracer(value, value)
